            <p>
              My name is Ina Elise Flom. I'm 29 years old and I live in Bergen,
              Norway.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm studying Front-End Development at Noroff, and I will be done
              with my studies in June 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
              Skills I've learned so far: Figma, GitHub, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS
              & JavaScript.

              <h1>About me</h1>
              <p>
                My name is Ina Elise Flom. I'm 28 years old and I live in
                Bergen, Norway. I'm originally from Tønsberg. I moved to Bergen
                in 2017 to study. The rain didn't bother me that much so I ended
                up staying here.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've got a bachelor's degree in archaeology but over the years I
                started developing an interest for programming and so I wanted
                to "dig deeper" into it. Therefore I'm getting a higher
                professional degree in Front-end development at Noroff. My
                studies will be completed in June 2025.
              </p>
              <p>
                A little bit about my hobbies: I love gaming - it has been a
                part of my life since I was young. I also enjoy working out at
                the gym, hiking, and crocheting.

                <p>This is my project for the JavaScript Frameworks course.</p>
                <p>
                  For this project we had to make an eCom store where all
                  functionality is managed by an existing API application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were allowed to use a CSS Framework but were encouraged to
                  design from scratch and use either styled-components or CSS
                  Modules. I chose CSS Modules. The project is built with Vite +
                  React.

                  We had to use everything we had learned so far into the
                  project. We were allowed to use a css framework, either
                  Bootstrap, TailwindCSS or MUI. My project is built with HTML,
                  TailwindCSS, Vite and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were asked to make a front-end user interface for an
                  existing API auction application.

                  We had to put everything we had learned from the past year
                  into this project. It's made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We
                  could not use frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were asked to make a front-end user interface for an

                  Bergen Science Museum was made as my contribution to my first
                  semester project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was a HTML and CSS only project. No frameworks or
                  JavaScript was allowed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were told to make a website for a science museum that were
                  to appeal to a younger audience without making it look
                  “childish”.

                  For the assignment we could choose between three briefs and I
                  chose Rainy Days, a jacket company.
