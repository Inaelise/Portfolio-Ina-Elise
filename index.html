                <p>
                  Rainy Days was my first assignment for the HTML & CSS course.
                  This website is only made with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the assignment we could choose between three briefs and I
                  chose Rainy Days, a jacket company.

                <p>
                  Bergen Science Museum was made as my contribution to my first
                  semester project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was a HTML and CSS only project. No frameworks or
                  JavaScript was allowed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were told to make a website for a science museum that were
                  to appeal to a younger audience without making it look
                  “childish”.

                <p>
                  This website was my contribution to my first project exam.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We had to put everything we had learned from the past year
                  into this project. It's made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We
                  could not use frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were asked to make a front-end user interface for an
                  existing API blogging application.
